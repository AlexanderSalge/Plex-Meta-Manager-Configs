# Language Flags # 

Always wanted Language Flags, now I've got them. Focused on German combinations mainly. 
Combinations up to three flags, won't do more to combat clutter. Also, I only need original language + german and optionally english if available.

## Supported Languages ##
- english
- german
- korean
- spanish
- norwegian
- japanese
- french

## Supported combinations ##
### (dual language) ###
- english with every language listed
- german with every language listed

### (triple language) ###
- english + german + any third language

## Flags ##
wanted to automate the flag-combination generating to enable more combinations, but no willing to get into imagemagick at this moment
